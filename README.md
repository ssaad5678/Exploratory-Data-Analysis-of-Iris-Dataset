# Iris Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Model 🌺📊

## Introduction ℹ️

Welcome to the Iris Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Model repository! This project aims to analyze the famous Iris dataset, visualize its characteristics, and build a machine learning model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their attributes. 

## Description 📝

This repository contains a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loads the Iris dataset and provides insights into its structure, statistical summary, duplicate entries, and class distribution.

2. **Data Visualization:** Visualizes the dataset using various plots such as scatter plots, pair plots, box plots, and violin plots to understand the relationships between different features and the distribution of data across different classes.

3. **Machine Learning Model:** Implements a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn to predict the species of iris flowers based on their attributes. The model is trained, evaluated, and used to make predictions on new data.

## How to Use 🚀

To use this script:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Python script `iris_analysis.py`.
4. The script will generate visualizations and display the accuracy of the machine learning model.
